# ES6 Awesomeness

## Introduction
You were introduced to some of the latest JS syntax, defined in the ECMAScript specification most often referred to  as ES6, during your front-end course. We will be using ES6 extensively in the Node.js portion, as well.  
Let's review some of the features you are familiar with, as well as some that may be new to you.  

<!-- TODO: Add details about -->
1. const and let
1. Object literal shorthand
1. Destructuring assignments
1. Fat arrow functions
1. Spread operator
1. Template literals 

## Requirements
Create a file called `cheer.js` that performs a cheer, using a named passed to it. Use as many of these as you can, even if the code you write isn't as compact or 'efficient' as you would like. This is more about trying out some ES6 than being succinct.

1. const and/or let
1. Object literal shorthand
1. Destructuring assignments
1. Fat arrow function(s)
1. Spread operator
1. Template literals  

Execute the file by typing `node cheer.js` inside the file's directory.  

Expected:  

```bash
$ node cheer.js
Give me a J!
Give me an O!
Give me an H!
Give me an N!
Give me a D!
Give me an O!
Give me an E!
What does that spell?
JOHN DOE!
```
Note: the 'a' vs. 'an'

## Bonus

-   Delay each line by 1 second
