# SQLite

SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero- configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

What does that mean?
1. SQLite does not require a separate server process or system to operate.
2. Creating a SQLite database instance is as easy as opening a file.
3. The entire database instance exists in a single cross-platform file.
