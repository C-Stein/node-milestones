# Templating With Pug

## Introduction

#### What is a templating engine?

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach enables us to render HTML files server side and send them to the client.

#### Pug

Pug is a clean, whitespace sensitive syntax for writing html. We will be using the Pug templating engine with our Express server.
