# Authentication

Authentication is the process of confirming the validity of credentials, such as a password. There are [three factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Factors_and_identity) of authentication, but we will focus on the **knowledge factor**. Examples of some elements belonging to the knowledge factor would be:
> Something the user knows (e.g., a password, Partial Password, pass phrase, or   personal identification number (PIN), challenge response (the user must answer a question, or pattern), Security question

Authenticating with a single user component would be referred to as single factor authentication. This is the most basic form of authentication, and **should not be used for personally sensitive transactions.**

Authentication should not be confused with **authorization**, which is the act of granting or rejecting a user access to resources based on specific rules or a policy.
